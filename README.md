# Roll-the-dice

Designed a simple dice roller app that returns a random value (1–6) with every reload using JavaScript’s Math.random() and EJS rendering.

Styled the UI with custom HTML/CSS and added a signature footer for personal branding.

Route /rolldice directly serves the generated value through server-side logic—great hands-on for learning randomness with templating.
